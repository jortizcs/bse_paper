\section{Introduction}

Buildings are sites of very large sensor deployments, typically containing
up to several thousand sensors reporting physical measurement, continuously.
Moreover, with the recent interest in reducing building energy consumption, it
is important to consider ways to quickly bootstrap a set of building data streams
into an anlytical pipeline to determine where there are opportunities for energy savings,
discovery of broken sensors, and assessing and tracking overall building performance.
However, current `point' naming conventions form a bottleneck in the scalability of
the data integration process.  A `point' refers to a physical location where
a sensor is taking measurements. Each building vendor uses their own naming scheme and
uniques variants of each scheme are implemented from building to building; variations exist
even across buildings that have contracted the same vendor to set up their deployment.
This makes the integration process laborious and fundamentally unscalable.  If we
wish to have a broad impact across the entire building stock, at scale, we need
to explore methods for overcoming this challenge.

Consider a simple analysis whcih has the ability
to identify anomalous readings from a specific kind of sensor.  In order to run the application
the deployer needs to know the name of the sensorand how to attain readings from it.
The stream identification process is manual.  The deployer loads the interface to the 
building management system, tracks down the spatial or system view, clicks through several windows
to locate the location of the point(s) of interest, mouses over the point(s) and records the name,
and then uses that point name to request it from the data-fetch protocol -- typically BACNet or 
LonTalk or another protocol. This process is repeated in \emph{every building} where this 
application runs.  Any application that uses building data requires access to the building
management system and the network carrying the data of interest.

In order to meaningfully deal with disparate building streams in a scalable 
fashion the streams should be \emph{searchable} across various properties, such
as building name, room location, and statistical trends.  Moreover, we
assert that wide searchability is necessary for achieving scalability.  By providing a tool for
searching across building streams, we minimize the deployment time for applications that 
allowing them to be used in \emph{all} buildings, not just a single one.  The aforementioned 
building manamgent system user interface implicitly groups sensors by location in space
or association with a system.  This grouping is also captured in the name of the point used by
the underlying communication protocol.  For example, 'AHU' -- air handling unit -- is typically
embedded in the name of every sensor that is associated with a particular air handling unit.
A similar convention is used for denoting the type of data produced by the point (i.e. all points
that contain 'ART' (area room temperature)  in their name refer to a temperature sensor).
However, these conventions vary slightly across buildings, making it difficult to
simply integrate based on such tags alone.  We need a way to unify and learn the basic
set and structure of the tags in order to unify them.

Also, commonality across certain statistical features can be used to group
different streams.  For example, consider the distribution of temperature reading across
the rooms in the building.  Given a value distribution, it might be easy to pick out values those
that classify as statistical anoamlies.  If you consider the distribution per sensor type, then
finding all statistically anomalous sensor might also identify those that are broken.
This can be determined and indexed a priori, easing the time it takes to identify the 
streams of interest to applications.

In this paper, we propose a technique which learns how to transform a building's metadata 
to a common namespace by using a small number of examples from an expert. Once the transformation 
rules are learnt for one building, it can be applied across buildings with a similar 
metadata structure.  We also show how processes that extract statistical features and generate
descriptive metadata can help unify data streams with respect to much deeper attributes.
We show how our approach makes it easier to write applications across buildings by
demonstrating its use by three different applications: 1) a rogue zone detector, 2)
a broken senor finder and 3) an application that identifies and ranks the most comfortable
rooms. We illustrate these on a testbed consisting of 60 buildings comprising more 
than 20,000 sensor points. We also illustrate how this common namespace can help a user write 
analytics applications that do not require building-specific knowledge and scales across 
different buildings. 

% We observe that every naming scheme looks to capture three point attributes: 
% 1) the location in space, 2) its relation to an subsytem, and 3) the type of 
% measurement it is taking.  

% We want to make the streams searchable.  How do we do that?
% ) We need index the metadata for the streams but the metadata available is not enough
% 2) We need to expand the metadata, but how?
% 3) name expansion --> tag unification
% 4) timeseries feature extraction --> tag unification

% top things to expand upon:  location, type, system
% secondary: statistical features about the data
