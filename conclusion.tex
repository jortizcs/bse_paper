\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We describe how a set of programming by example techniques can be used to
 learns how to transform a building's metadata 
to a common namespace by using a small number of examples from an expert. Once the transformation 
rules are learnt for one building, it can be applied across buildings with a similar 
metadata structure.  
We show how our approach makes it easier to write applications across buildings by
demonstrating its use by three different applications: 1) a rogue zone detector, 2)
a broken senor finder and 3) an application that identifies and ranks the most comfortable
rooms. We illustrate these on a testbed consisting of nearly 60 buildings comprising more 
than 20,000 sense points. We also illustrate how this common namespace can help a user write 
analytics applications that do not require building-specific knowledge and scales across 
different buildings.
